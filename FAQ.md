Frequently asked questions
==========================

## Why?

Every child has the right to be healthy! We need to accellerate the fight against hunger with innovations in order to have a chance to reach Zero Hunger by 2030.

## Why do you need to measure? Anyone can see if a child is malnourished!

That is a common misconception. Many people think of starving children with water belly when thinking of hunger. But this is just the most extreme expression of hunger.

There over 45 million children in the world who are wasting. When it is detected that a child is wasting, it is often already too late. Governments, UN Organisations and NGOs need quick and accurate data to plan efficient programmes and targeted interventions to reach zero hunger.

Also there are more than 148 million children who are stunting. They will be weaker, more often sick, not be able to concentrate and learn in schools and eventually earn 19% less than their healthy neighbors. **Even health professionals cannot detect this without knowing the age and measuring the child**. So in order to detect stunting mother-child-care centers and community outreach centers measure these children. But current methods of measurement need expensive measuring boards, medical grade scales and trained professionals. Even if these prerequisites are available, measurements take a lot of time and suffer from human error, especially in stressful situations when the children are moving.

## How do you detect malnutrition?

We "scan" the children with a smartphone app, it is basically like taking a short video. From that video we derive metric information and the human pose that we use to measure the height of the child. Also from this 3D data over time, we build a 3D model of the child which we can then use to predict the weight, arm-circumference and head-circumference. Toghether with the age from the birth certificate, that is all information that is needed to do a professional nutritional assessment.

## What about Privacy and data security?

The data belongs to the children and we have merely the right to use it in order to provide basic human rights. We are a non-profit initiative and we take privacy and data security very serious!

Before any data is collected or accessed a informed consent sheet, signed by the parents of the child and containing a QR code needs to be scanned. Data is transmitted and stored only encrypted. Adhering to the need-to-know principle, only the product owner and one admin have access to the full data. An ETL process then removes all personal information before it gets transported into the machine learning backend for predictions and training. Selected Data scientists use our closed JupyterHub environment to access the non-PII data for developing and training their algorithms.

## How can i contribute?

You could donate time in our GitHub Projects or money for the development and pilot projects. Get in touch through info@childgrowthmonitor.org or simply donate at https://welthungerhilfe.de/child-growth-monitor-donation

## Are the decisions that are being taken with the app correct?

Currently we are not generating a diagnosis. As we are following a collaborative approach, we want to reuse source code or integrate existing applications from the development sector for that. The roll-out process also involves that we are not only predicting results like height, weight and arm circumference (muac), but that we also provide the information of how good our predictions are for the given scan data.

## Is the decision-making process transparent?

We think it is very important that decisions that are supported by artificial intelligence are especially transparent. This is one of the reasons why we are licensing all our code under GPLv3. Also our algorithms provides results (height,weight,arm- and head-circumference) that can be manually measured and therefore verified (and improved) by humans. Feedback on scan quality and therefore reliability of the predicted results is also very important.

## Where do you get the money to build a product like this?

Currently we are funded by donations, mostly of large companies. Additionally Microsoft provides cloud services and experts. Eventually we want to build this into a sustainable non-profit social business.

## Isn't this contributing to overpopulation?

All scientific evidence points to a simple outcome: If parents have healthy children, they also have less children. By making sure that all children are healthy we contribute to a solution of overpopulation. Also only children who are healthy and can reach their full potential can come up with new solutions to the problems that come with overpopulation, climate change, plastic pollution, etc.
